# Udacity-MLND-Capstone
The training dataset (file:train.bson, size: 62GB) that will be used in this project has been downloaded from website of Kaggle in the webpage:[(Cdiscountâ€™s Image Classification Challenge)] (https://www.kaggle.com/c/cdiscount-image-classification-challenge) 

The file data_preprocessing_and_deep_learning_models_(stage I).ipynb documents preprocessing of the dataset and the the training of the stage I model. The file XGBoost_classifiers_(stage II).ipynb documents the training of the stage II model.

The detailed information about the implementation of the project is summarized in the final thesis of the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree Program: Capstone_Project_Jin-Lu.
